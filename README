PullToRefreshViewController based on:

Enormego's EGOTableViewPullRefresh:
http://github.com/enormego/EGOTableViewPullRefresh

And: dropnik's suggested changed to make it more MVC:
http://www.drobnik.com/touch/2009/12/how-to-make-a-pull-to-reload-tableview-just-like-tweetie-2/

pulled the source from DBloete's ioctocat repo:
http://github.com/dbloete/ioctocat


I just wanted to make it easier for people to use these classes, and not have to check out lot's of different sources.
